             <h2 class="topic"><b>Donor selection criteria</b></h2>
            <img src="images/Donate_page2.jpg" height="100%" width="100%">
            
            <p>In a blood donation system, ensuring the safety of both donors and recipients is paramount. Donor selection criteria help identify individuals who are suitable to donate blood while minimizing the risk of transfusion-transmissible infections and adverse reactions. Here are common donor selection criteria:</p>
            <ul>
            
            <li>Age:</li>
            Donors typically need to be within a certain age range, often between 18 to 65 years old. The minimum age may vary by jurisdiction and organization.
            <li>Weight:</li>
            Donors must weigh above a certain threshold, usually around 50 kilograms (110 pounds), to ensure they can safely donate without experiencing adverse effects.
            <li>Health Status:</li>
            Donors should be in good health and free from acute or chronic illnesses at the time of donation.<br>
            Individuals with conditions such as cold, flu, or infections should postpone donation until they have fully recovered.
            <li>Travel History:</li>
            Donors may be deferred based on recent travel to regions with endemic diseases or outbreaks, such as malaria or Zika virus-affected areas.
            <li>Medical History:</li>
            Donors are asked to provide information about their medical history, including past surgeries, blood transfusions, and chronic conditions.

        <h2 class="topic"><b>High-Risk Behaviors</b></h2>
        <img src="images/Donate_page3.jpg" width="100%"; height="100%">
        <ul>
        <li>Donors who engage in behaviors associated with an increased risk of transfusion-transmissible infections, such as intravenous drug use or unprotected sexual activity with multiple partners, may be deferred.</li>
        <li>Individuals who have received tattoos or piercings within a specified time frame (usually within the past 6 to 12 months) may be deferred due to the risk of bloodborne infections.</li>
        <li>Donors who have lived in or traveled to regions with a high prevalence of specific infectious diseases, such as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) or malaria, may be deferred for a specified period.</li>
        <li>Military personnel and individuals deployed to certain regions may have additional criteria based on exposure to infectious diseases or environmental factors.</li>
        <li>Pregnant individuals are usually deferred from blood donation due to the physiological changes and potential risks to both the donor and the recipient.</li>
        <li>Individuals with a history of hepatitis B or C, HIV/AIDS, or other bloodborne infections are typically deferred from blood donation.</ul></li></p>

        <h2 class="topic"><b>Type of donors</b></h2>
        <img src="images/Donate_page1.jpg" width="100%"; height="100%" class="">
      <ul>
        <li>Voluntory non remunerated donors. (donate for the sake of others and do not expect any benefit. their blood is considered safe and healthy)</li>
        <li>Replacement donors. (donate to replace the units used for their friends or family members)</li>
        <li>Paid donors. (receive payment for donation)</li>
        <li>Directed donors. (donate only for a specific patient's requirement)</li>
        <li>Replacement and Paid donors are no longer accepted by blood banks. Replacement donation was carried out until recently in some blood banks due to the shortage of blood stocks. Asking patients for replacement donors will lead to more pressure on the relatives, who are already in stress and this in turn results in illegal paid donations.</ul></li></p>
